# Decentralized Escrow Service

## Project Overview

The Decentralized Escrow Service is a smart contract built on the Soroban platform designed to facilitate secure and transparent peer-to-peer transactions. It acts as a trusted intermediary that holds funds in escrow until the transaction terms are fulfilled, providing a solution for mitigating trust and risk issues in various use cases such as e-commerce, freelance services, and real estate.

### Key Features

- **Secure Fund Management**: Lock funds in escrow until conditions are met.
- **Dispute Resolution**: Mechanisms for raising and resolving disputes with optional arbitration.
- **Auditability**: Transparent logging of all actions for accountability.

### Prerequisites

- Rust and Cargo installed on your system.
- Familiarity with the Soroban SDK and smart contract development.

## Setup & Installation

### Dependencies

Ensure you have the following dependencies in your `Cargo.toml`:


### Build Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   
2. Build the project:
   
### Deployment Steps

1. Deploy the contract using the Soroban CLI or your preferred deployment tool.
2. Initialize the contract by calling the `initialize` function.
